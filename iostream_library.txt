   These classes are prefixed with keyword basic_ in the STL Documentation.
   These can be specialised for different char types. (like wistream..for wchar_t)
   The  std::ios represents an object that maintains a stream of data that can be in good state, empty of data(EOF) state or some fail state.

   ifstream, ofstream and fstream inherit from istream, ostream and iostream respectively, but lift their capabilities to redirect the I/O from and to files from the computer's filesystem.

  The istringstream, ostringstream and iostringstream work pretty analogously. They help build strings in memory, and/or consuming data from them.
