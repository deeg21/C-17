/*
   Date: 9th July, 2023
   Implementing a TODO list using priority queue and arrange the items according to highest to lowest priority.
   priority queue: a priority queue is another container adapter like std:stack.
   It is a min heap or a max heap. 
   It provides a wrapper for another data structure and provides a queue like interface.
   Its a FIFO data structure, unlike stack, opposite of stack.
   as we know in every subtree, the parent node is min or max.

   The comparison operator < handles different cases. Let's assume we compare
    left < rightÃ‚ and left and right are pairs.
    1. The left.first != right.first, then it returns left.first <right.first.
    2. The left.first == right.first, then it returns left.second <right.second.
