* Structured Bindings:  How to access individual members of tuples,pairs, structures,static arrays with structured bindings. 
  And assign these values to individual variables.
  A lot of fundamental data structures from the STL are immediately accessible using structured bindings without us having to change
  anything.
 The list of variables√Ç var1, var2, ... must exactly match the number of variables contained by the expression being assigned from.
 The <pair, tuple, struct, or array expression> must be one of the following:
   An std::pair.
   An std::tuple.
   A struct. 
  All members must be non-static and defined in the same base class. The first declared member is assigned to the first
  variable, the second member to the second variable, and so on.

  **------An array of fixed size. The type can be auto, const auto, const auto&, and even auto&&.------****
